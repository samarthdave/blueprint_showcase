## Blueprint Showcase

A simple React project built with the UI library [Blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)

### What is Blueprint?

```
"Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

It is optimized for building complex, data-dense web interfaces for desktop applications. If you rely heavily on mobile interactions and are looking for a mobile-first UI toolkit, this may not be for you."
```

### How to run
```
npm install
or
yarn install
```
then
```npm start```

### Website
I decided to use surge.sh to deploy this react site.
Look at the package.json to see how to deploy.

Create a free, fast website at [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/);
