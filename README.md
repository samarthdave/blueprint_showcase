## Blueprint Showcase

A simple React project built with the UI library [Blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)

### What is Blueprint?


"Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

It is optimized for building complex, data-dense web interfaces for desktop applications. If you rely heavily on mobile interactions and are looking for a mobile-first UI toolkit, this may not be for you."
